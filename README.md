## High-Level Features
- **Influencer Discovery**: Automatically pulls recent health-related tweets and podcast transcripts.
- **Claim Detection**: Identifies health claims and categorizes them into topics like Nutrition, Medicine, and Mental Health.
- **Claim Verification**: Uses AI logic to cross-reference claims with reliable journals and assigns a trust score.
- **Dashboard Display**: Provides a leaderboard showcasing influencers, trust scores, follower counts, and claim statistics.
- **Research Configuration**: Allows users to configure date ranges, the number of claims to analyze, and the journals to be used.
